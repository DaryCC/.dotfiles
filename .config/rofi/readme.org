* CONFIGURATION
        There are currently three methods of setting  configuration
       options (evaluated in order below):

              + System    configuration    file     (for   example
                /etc/rofi.rasi).  It first checks XDG_CONFIG_DIRS,
                and  then  SYSCONFDIR  (that  is passed at compile
                time).  It loads the first config file  it  finds,
                it  does  not  merge multiple system configuration
                files.

              + Rasi theme file: The new theme format can be  used
                to set configuration values.

              + Command-line options: Arguments passed to rofi.
